Stefan's simple dotfiles
========

My personal shell dotfiles for BASH &amp; Bourne Shell on CentOS, Ubuntu, FreeBSD &amp; MacOSX

My philosophy:

* Keep it simple
* Stick with the common defaults. Fancy customizations get you in trouble because some day soon you'll be on a system without your personal utilities. Up the creek without your fancy-schmancy paddle.
* aliases & functions should have unique names. For example, `alias ls='ls -la'` or `alias 'rm=rm -i'` encourages bad habits.
* I prefer colors. Colors are much more intuitive then boring old monochrome.
